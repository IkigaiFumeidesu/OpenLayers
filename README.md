# OpenLayers Project Manual
## Overview
This project is a web application built with React, OpenLayers, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It utilizes the OpenLayers library to provide rich, interactive maps.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js (version 14 or above)
npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
## Installation
### Cloning the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/IkigaiFumeidesu/OpenLayers.git
cd OpenLayers 
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Yes, you should navigate to token.js and insert your own API key, though I don't suspect this to be available for an average user. 
## Installing Dependencies
### Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
```
npm install
```
This command will read the package.json file and install all the required libraries and dependencies for the project.

Configuration
There might be environment variables or configuration files you need to set up. For this project, if there's any .env file or similar configuration needed, you would typically do:

## Running the Code

```
npm start
```
This command will start the React development server.

## Building for Production
To create an optimized build for production, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a build directory with a production build of your app. You can then serve it with a static server or deploy it to a hosting service.

You can interact with the map and use any features that have been implemented within the app.
